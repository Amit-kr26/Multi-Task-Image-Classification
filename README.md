# Multi-Task-Image-Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a comprehensive machine learning workflow, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference. The project uses PyTorch to build a deep learning model for multi-task classification, predicting attributes such as color, type, season, and category from images.

The model is trained on a dataset of product images (available on Kaggle) and tested on external samples. Here the model link- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nOiFVZS8ERt7v788exPnjC980-prW80s/view?usp=sharing
